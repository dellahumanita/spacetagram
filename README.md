# Shopify Summer 2022 Front-end Intern Challenge
Spacetagram is an image-viewing app that displays images from NASA's Picture of the Day API for the last 30 days.

My goal with this app is to focus on displaying the images in a simple, minimalist layout that is entirely responsive.

This project was created with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and animations were made using Framer.
